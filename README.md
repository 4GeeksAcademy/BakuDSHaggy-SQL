## üå±  How to start this project.

Follow the instructions below:

This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately.

We recommend opening this very same repository using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command. 

This is the repository you need to fork and open:

```
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/connecting-to-a-sql-database-project-tutorial
```

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

Once your project and code has finished opening you can go ahead and open the `app.py` file and start solving each exercise inside the notebook.

## üöõ How to deliver this project

Once you have finished solving the exercises, be sure to commit your changes, push to your repository and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.

## üìù Instructions

Read the contents of the `./INSTRUCTIONS.md` file containing the steps to complete the project, follow them and develop the solution first in `./src/explore.ipynb` for testing and then move the clean code to `./src/app.py`. Be sure to delete the notebook once you no longer need it to keep the project clean and tidy.

We also incorporated the solution samples on `./src/solution.py` that we strongly suggest you only use if you are stuck for more than 30min or if you have already finished and want to compare it with your approach.
